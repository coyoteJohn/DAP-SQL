# DAP-SQL

DAP Student review scripts for SQLite exercises.

## Code of conduct

Ultimately your 'grade' is best represented by the results of your job search. I expect everyone in the cohort to do their own, best, work. These scripts are here to help you recreated the practice database and to review concepts. I encourage you to experiment, break things, and learn. Just running these scripts will get you a working database, the learning is on you.

## Work in progress

The scripts in this repo will change frequently. Sometimes as a class is in session. Pull early, pull often.
