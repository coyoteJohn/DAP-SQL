# DAP-SQL

DAP Student review scripts for SQLite exercises.

## Code of conduct

Ultimately your 'grade' is best represented by the results of your job search. I expect everyone in the cohort to do their own, best, work. These scripts are here to help you recreated the practice database and to review concepts. Cheat if you must, in the end you are only cheating yourself. 

## Work in progress

The scripts in this repo will change frequently. Sometimes as a class is in session. Pull early, pull often.
